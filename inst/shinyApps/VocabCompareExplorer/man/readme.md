### Introduction

Welcome to TANTALUS.

TANTALUS is an open source application developed as a part of OHDSI intended to help expose differences between two vocabulary versions. 

The data is generated using the [Tantalus R Package](https://github.com/OHDSI/Tantalus)

The following comparison queries are currently available:

<html>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>ID</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>9.01 </td>
<td>Concept name changed</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>10.01 </td>
<td>Concept domain changed</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>99.01 </td>
<td>Source concepts with new standard mappings, including 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</html>


In **tabular** view you can select the results for the following aggregation levels: description, domain, or vocabulary.

After selecting an aggregation key, you can filter the results table by clicking on the rows in the table that is generated. 
Additional filtering and search options are available per column on the top of the table and overall on top of the page.

There is an option to download the results (those that are in view as defined by the "entries") as csv or excel file.

**Graphical view** is under consideration.

Note you can remove the side bar if more space is needed using the button in the header.
